#' Compare how a coefficient differs between models
#'
#' This function compares the coefficient of one variable across two models.
#' It can be used for mediation analysis to check if a mediator significantly reduces the coefficient of that variable.
#' Another use case is when the model doesn't allow a specification of an interaction effect like the did package.
#' Here you can run the model for different groups and compare the estimates.
#' The function should only be used for comparing models with the same dependent variable unless it is standardized.
#'
#' It is compatible with lm(), lm_robust(), feols() and aggte().
#' The formula (based on Paternoster et al. (1998)) for the calculation is:
#' \deqn{Z = \frac{b_1 - b_2}{\sqrt{SE_{b_1}^2 + SE_{b_2}^2}}}
#'
#' @param m1 A model object. The first model to compare.
#' @param m2 A model object. The second model to compare.
#' @param coef A string. The name of the coefficient to compare, as it appears in the model summary.
#' @return A list with the difference in the coefficient, the z-value, and the p-value.
